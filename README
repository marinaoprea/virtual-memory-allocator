Virtual Memory Allocator: Tema 1

Description:
    Current C programm proposes implementation for a virtual memory allocator 
that takes user commands from input and simulates allocation, usage and
deallocation of a memory arena.

ALLOC_ARENA:
    arena is simulated through a doubly linked list of disjunct blocks;
    here we alloc this simulating structure

ALLOC_BLOCK:
    block, continuous memory zone is simulated by a doubly linked list of 
    adjacent miniblocks
    blocks are maintained in increasing order based on start address
    firstly, we check if the new zone is adjacent to a block to the left; we
    insert a new miniblock in this block's list; then we verify if the next block is also adjacent; in this case we redo the links of first and
    last miniblock nodes so that all are added to the left block and free
    the right block's node
    in case of total disjunction a new block is formed and inserted in the
    arena block list

FREE_BLOCK:
    special cases are freeing the first or last miniblock of a block;
    in this case, we eliminate the node from the miniblock list and free 
    the block if now is empty;
    in case we free a miniblock in the middle of a block we create a new block 
    node and make its info point to the right part of the split block

PMAP:
    parses the arena and prints necessary information

WRITE:
    deep copies given data to corresponding rw_buffers

READ:
    prints stored information from corresponding rw_buffer

MPROTECT:
    updates permissions; permissions are handled in octal form;
    thus we use bit operations for adding 1 on 0th, 1st or 2nd bit

Comments:
    Search of specific element is linear, despite the list elements
being ordered; doubly linked list structure does not support binary
search, but it optimizes introduction of new elements and redemensioning
the list.
    Homework topic gives a glimpse of data structure use in real life
problems and emphasizes doubly linkd list advantages; also it imposes great
understanding of links and their meaning.
